"""Postgres dialect for the brain record store.

``PostgresStateStore`` serves the exact surface the services were written
against on SQLite: ``connect()`` returns a connection whose ``execute``
accepts ``?`` placeholders and returns mapping rows, and ``transaction()``
yields one under single-writer semantics. The seam is deliberately thin —
a string-level placeholder translation (the codebase never uses ``?`` or
``%`` inside SQL string literals; tests/state/test_postgres_dialect.py keeps
that invariant honest) plus a DDL translation of the one SCHEMA constant.

Single-writer semantics: SQLite gets them from ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``; here a
``pg_advisory_xact_lock`` keyed on the DSN serializes every write transaction.
The UI's recent activity/tool-I/O rings are process-local diagnostics and are
not part of this record-store dialect.

psycopg is imported lazily so SQLite-backed test and development compositions
do not import it.
