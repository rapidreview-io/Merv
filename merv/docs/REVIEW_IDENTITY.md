# Review Identity

## Boundary

Design, experiment, and reflection reviews are intended to come from a session
distinct from the producer. The brain enforces a declared-session separation:

```text
review request + request-scoped capability + reviewer session + immutable target snapshot
```

The mechanism does not trust prompt text, IP addresses, or a claimed agent name.
It also cannot authenticate the caller-supplied session strings, so the boundary
is workflow-level rather than cryptographic identity.

## Protocol

1. The producer submits the plan, attempt artifacts, or reflection artifacts.
2. The producer calls:

   ```text
   review.request(project_id, target_type, target_id, role, reason?, producer_session_id?)
   ```

3. For `design_reviewer`, `experiment_reviewer`, `reflection_reviewer`, and
   `consolidation_reviewer`, the brain validates that the role matches the
   active gate. `human` and `automated_check` are gate-exempt. The brain pins
   the target snapshot, hashes a newly minted capability, and stores only that
   hash.
4. The response returns the plaintext capability once, together with
   `reviewer_handoff.spawn_prompt` containing the correct reviewer skill and
   target context.
5. A separate reviewer session presents the capability:

   ```text
   review.start(review_request_id, reviewer_capability, caller_session_id)
   ```

   `caller_session_id` is required and its declared value must differ from the
   producer's declared session value. The session records the verified
   `agent_id` of the context window that started it.
6. `review.start` returns the project's `{id, name, summary}`, the target's
   slim experiment or reflection context, and the current attempt's full
   submitted gated-role artifacts; other pinned ids (logic graph, metrics
   exhibit) are read with `artifact.read`. Ordinary code, input, result,
   config, model, and note files are not bundled. The reviewer skill imposes a
   procedural read-only role. The reviewer submits one structured verdict
   through:

   ```text
   review.submit(review_session_id, verdict, synopsis, return_to?, notes?, findings?, evidence?)
   ```

The requesting session must not start the review on the reviewer's behalf. The
server can compare the two declared strings, but cannot prove which client made
the call.

## Snapshot and capability checks

At `review.start`, the brain rejects the call when:

- the capability is missing, expired, or invalid;
- a newer request superseded the request;
- the target snapshot changed after the request was created; or
- the declared `caller_session_id` equals the declared producer session.

The workflow-role/gate match is checked earlier, when `review.request` creates
the request.

At `review.submit`, the caller presents only `review_session_id`. The brain
rejects a missing/already-submitted session, a request that is no longer open, a
changed target snapshot, a payload/`return_to` that violates the role
contract, or a caller whose `agent_id` is not the one that started the session.
It does not receive or recheck the capability or its expiry at submission
time. The verdict applies its graph route in the same transaction and the
receipt reports the target's status before and after.

The request remains startable while its status is `requested` or `started` and
its capability is unexpired, so a capability is not consumed by the first
`review.start`. The first accepted submission closes the request, so any other
started session can no longer submit. The reviewer skills provide the read-only
operating boundary; the hard server boundary is that only a passing
`review.submit` with the workflow gate's exact role and current snapshot can
satisfy that gate. The dispatcher also rejects other mutations when they
explicitly carry a `review_session_id`.

Requesting a fresh capability for the same target and role is
revoke-and-reissue: all prior requested or started sessions for that gate become
`superseded`. Plaintext capabilities are never recoverable from durable state.

## What the snapshot pins

The snapshot identifies the target status, attempt, and exact submitted artifact
versions. `review.start` bundles pinned bytes for the gated artifacts and any
system metrics exhibit, alongside project and target context read at successful
review start. Ordinary artifact ids remain snapshot references but their bytes
are not included in that response. Reviewers judge the bundled submissions
rather than later working-tree edits. A gated file revision must be
re-registered and reviewed under a fresh snapshot.

Experiment-attempt rejections must choose:

- `return_to="running"` when the approved plan still stands and execution or the
  conclusion needs work;
- `return_to="planned"` when the design is flawed and a new attempt is required.

Reflection rejections choose `synthesizing` or `reflecting`. Design-review
rejections always return to `planned`.

## Independence level

Every newly created reviewer session records `verified_agent_review` because a
distinct, non-empty `caller_session_id` is mandatory. `attested_agent_review`
exists only on legacy rows created before that requirement.

This records only that two caller-supplied strings were non-empty and unequal.
It does not prove that two clients—or two independent models—performed the
reasoning. Submission needs `review_session_id` from the context window whose
`agent_id` opened the session; that id names a context window, not a model.
