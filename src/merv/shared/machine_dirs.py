"""Machine-level (per-user home) state-directory names and resolution.

The sibling of ``project_dirs`` for home-scoped ``client.json``. A machine
that already has ``~/.research_plugin/`` keeps using it forever; a machine
without one (fresh installs included) keeps its client state under
``~/.merv/``. Resolution is per-call and never cached: the legacy dir wins
from the moment it exists, so all consumers converge on one answer within a
process.
